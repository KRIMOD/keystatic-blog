title: Building a share text selection to Twitter feature in React
slug: share-text-selection-to-twitter
summary: >-
  Medium has a feature that lets readers share selected article text straight to
  Twitter — without having to copy, paste and edit. It’s a cool way to support
  sharing without drawing the user too far away from their reading experience.
  But, that same nifty sharing feature isn’t available for all the great content
  on the internet.
