This post is to show all. the different components that we have the ability to use directly in the document editor of Keystatic.

If you want to play around with these in the editor head over to this post in the Keystatic admin pannel.

If you want to see how they're setup take a look at the `keystatic.tsx` file and look at the `componentBlocks` of the `Posts` collection.

## Image (with caption)

This is a more styled version of just using a markdown image syntax including `alt` text and  `caption`

{% image
   src="learning-loop.jpg"
   alt="Thinkmill Cover image"
   caption="Oh wow what a nice caption" /%}

## Looping Video

This is running a `.mov` file in the style of a looping gif. Running the component this way we get to keep up the performance benefits of using a video file over a gif.

{% loopingVideo
   src="rendering-gif.mov"
   caption="An example of SSR vs PSSR from another article on the Thinkmill website" /%}
